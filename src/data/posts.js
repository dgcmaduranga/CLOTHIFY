      <p>A capsule wardrobe focuses on fewer, better pieces that mix and match. Start with neutral colors, then layer in 2–3 seasonal highlights.</p>
      <h3>The 12 core pieces</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 shirts · white & blue</li>
        <li>1 tee · heavy cotton</li>
        <li>1 blazer · navy</li>
        <li>2 bottoms · denim & tailored</li>
        <li>1 knit · wool or cashmere</li>
        <li>1 coat · trench or parka</li>
        <li>3 shoes · sneakers, boots, loafers</li>
        <li>2 accessories · belt & scarf</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Quality over quantity. Fit over everything.</p>

      <p>Wash less, air more. Cold water saves color and fabric life.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Wool:</b> hand wash or gentle cycle; lay flat to dry.</li>
        <li><b>Denim:</b> turn inside out; wash cold; skip the dryer.</li>
        <li><b>Silk:</b> delicate bag; mild detergent; no wringing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always read the care label — it's there for a reason.</p>
